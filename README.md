# NOAA ERI Autoencoder

This is an notebook to creat a convolutional autoencoder for 130k NOAA Emergency response images after hurricanes.

The trained autoencoder shrinks each image down into 1000 (or fewer) dimensions.

the next step is to work to cluster these images based on those reduced dimensions.
